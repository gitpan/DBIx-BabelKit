Code Table Setup</h2></center>

How to set up a BabelKit code table.  This consists of
the database table definition and at least five core code records
that need to be loaded for the BabelKit Translation Utility to function.


<h4>Sample Schema</h4>

Here is a sample MySQL code table schema definition plus
a few example English and French month code records.
Feel free to adapt these field definitions to your needs
and your database management system as outlined below.

<pre>
CREATE TABLE bk_code (
  code_set varchar(16) binary NOT NULL default '',
  code_lang varchar(5) binary NOT NULL default '',
  code_code varchar(32) binary NOT NULL default '',
  code_desc blob NOT NULL,
  code_order smallint(6) NOT NULL default '0',
  code_flag char(1) binary NOT NULL default '',
  PRIMARY KEY  (code_set, code_lang, code_code)
);

INSERT INTO bk_code VALUES ('month', 'en', '5',  'May',      5,'');
INSERT INTO bk_code VALUES ('month', 'en', '10', 'October', 10,'')
INSERT INTO bk_code VALUES ('month', 'fr', '5',  'mai',      0,'');
INSERT INTO bk_code VALUES ('month', 'fr', '10', 'octobre',  0,'');
</pre>

The default code table name is <b>bk_code</b>.  BabelKit can
support multiple code tables per database, although this
is rarely necessary.  If your code table name is other than
'bk_code' pass the code table name into the new BabelKit() method.

<p>
The <b>code_set</b> field holds the code for the code set
that each code record belongs to.  For example, each
code record for the month code set will have a code_set
value of 'month'.  The code_set field is limited to
16 characters by the Translation Utility.

<p>
The <b>code_lang</b> field holds the code for the language
that each code record belongs to.  For example, each
French code record will have a code_lang value of 'fr'.
The code_lang field is limited to 5 characters by the
Translation Utility.
This leaves room for the two character language
code plus a dialect such as 'en-us' for U.S. English.
All code records must exist first in the native language.

<p>
The <b>code_code</b> field holds the actual code value.
For example '10' for the month of October, or 'cad' for
Canadian Dollars.  The code_code field is limited to 32
characters by the Translation Utility.
Codes rarely need to be that long and since long code values
can take up considerable space in the database proper,
they should be kept to a reasonable length.

<p>
Code_set, code_lang and code_code values all consist
of alphanumeric plus '-' and '_' like this: /^[a-zA-Z_0-9-]+$/.
Avoid html or url unsafe characters such as [&amp;&lt;&quot&gt;?=]
or spaces in your codes.  BabelKit assumes that all
codes are html and url safe and does not encode them.

<p>
The <b>code_desc</b> field holds the code description for
the code, one record for each language translation.
For example 'October' for the English description
and 'ottobre' for the French description.  None of
the code_set, code_lang, code_code or code_desc fields
may be blank.

<p>
In this example the code_desc field is defined as a
'blob' which has a limit of 65535 characters under MySQL.
This would be appropriate if you are using BabelKit to
support translation of paragraphs or pages of text.  If you
expect to be keeping only regular code descriptions
then varchar(255) will be plenty.

<p>
The <b>code_order</b> field is used to specify the sort
order for a code set.  It is only set in the native
language code records, the 'en' records in the example
above.  If the month sort order were not set,
'10' would sort before '5', displaying October
before May.  Negative code_order numbers can be used
to make a code sort early.  See the 'code_set' records
below for an example of this.

<p>
When a code is first added in the native language,
if the code_order field is not specified and the
code_code field value is numeric, the code_order field is set
to the value of the code_code field.  This provides numeric
sorting by default which can be overridden as necessary
by specifying the code_order field values.

<p>
The example schema above defines code_order as a two byte
signed integer.  If you expect code_order values above 32767
then define code_order as a four byte signed integer field.

<p>
The <b>code_flag</b> field is a one character field used
to tag obsolete records as deprecated with a 'd' value.
The 'd' flags are only stored in the native language records.
Deprecated code descriptions are still available for
display of old database values, but are not available
for new data entry selections.


<h4>Core Data Records</h4>

The BabelKit Translation Utility requires at least
five core data records to be loaded before it can function properly:

<pre>
INSERT INTO bk_code VALUES ('code_set',  'en', 'code_set',  'code set',   -3,'');
INSERT INTO bk_code VALUES ('code_set',  'en', 'code_lang', 'language',   -2,'');
INSERT INTO bk_code VALUES ('code_set',  'en', 'code_admin','code admin', -1,'');

INSERT INTO bk_code VALUES ('code_admin','en', 'code_admin', 'param=1 slave=1',
                            0,'');

INSERT INTO bk_code VALUES ('code_lang', 'en', 'en',        'English',    -1,'');
</pre>

<p>
Three code_set records define the three core code sets.
One code_lang record defines the native language.

<p>
They should all be in the native language.  BabelKit discovers
which language is the native language for this code table by
looking at the language of the 'code_admin' 'code_admin' record.
In this case 'en' for English.

<p>
To initialize a code table with another native language
replace the 'en' values above with another language code.
At some point it might be fun to make the BabelKit Translation
Utility user interface multilingual.


<h4>Loading the Schema Definition and Core Data Records</h4>

Load the schema definition.  With MySQL, do this:

<pre>
$ mysql yourdatabasename &lt; data/bk_schema.mysql
</pre>

Load the core data records.  With MySQL, do this:

<pre>
$ mysql yourdatabasename &lt; data/bk_setup.core
</pre>

<a name="demodata"></a>
You can optionally load the demo data records.  With MySQL, do this:

<pre>
$ mysql yourdatabasename &lt; data/bk_demo.latin1
</pre>

Make sure that your records are loaded.  With MySQL, do this:

<pre>
$ mysqldump yourdatabasename bk_code | less
</pre>

You should see your schema definition and the data
records that you have loaded.
