Translation Utility</h2></center>

The BabelKit Translation Utility lets you enter codes
and their translations into the universal code table.

<h4>Main Translation Page</h4>

The main translation page shows a grid with the code sets
listed along the left margin and the languages to translate
them into along the top.  Each position in the grid displays
the count of codes in that code set and language:

<pre>
                    en    de    es    fr    it
code_set             7     7     7     7     7
code_lang            5     5     5     5     5
country             87    87    87    87    87
currency            12    12    12    12    12
day                  7     7     7     7     7
month               12    12    12    12    12
                   130   130   130   130   130
</pre>

In this case, the native language is "en" for English.
If any of the non-native languages are missing some
translations, that count will be displayed in red
to highlight where translation work is needed.

<p>
If you click on the counts under any of the non-native
languages you will get a display of each of the codes
for that code set showing both the native language descriptions
and the selected translation language descriptions.
Click on any code to add or amend a translation.

<p>
Click on any of the code sets along the left column
to see a list of just the native language descriptions.
From there click on any of the codes to see all of
the language descriptions displayed together.

<h4>Selecting Another Code Set or Language</h4>

At any point you can click on the "Main Translation
Page" link to return to the overview and then click
on any of the translation counts to view another
translation set.

<p>
The other navigation aid is always displayed at the top
of every page:

<pre>
      Select a code set and language(s)
    [Code Set?] [English] [(Other)] [View]
</pre>

The first select dropdown lets you specify the code set
that you are interested in.  The second lets you specify
the primary language and the third lets you specify
an optional secondary language.  Then click [View]
to see the selected set.


<h4>Adding a New Code Set</h4>

Click on "code_set" along the left margin of the
Main Translation Page or select "Code set" from
the navigation dropdown to see the current list
of code sets.  Click the "Add new code set record"
link at the bottom of the page.

<p>
Enter the new code set code and the native language
description.  For example "city" and "city".
Click the "Parameter Set", "Slave Set" and "Multiline Set"
boxes if appropriate.  See the <a href="bk_overview.html">
BabelKit Overview</a> page for an explanation of
these options.  Click [Add] and start adding the
codes for the new code set.


<h4>Adding a New Translation Language</h4>

Click on "code_lang" along the left margin of the
Main Translation Page or select "Language" from
the navigation dropdown to see the current list
of translation languages.  Click the "Add new language record"
link at the bottom of the page.

<p>
Enter the new language code and the language description.
For example "es" and "Spanish".  Click [Add].  Happy translation!


<h4>Code Display Order</h4>

When adding or updating a code you can specify its
display order by entering a number in the "Code Order"
field.  Negative order numbers can be used to make
a code sort early.

<p>
When a code is first added in the native language,
if the order field is not specified and the code field
value is numeric, the order field is set to the value
of the code field. This provides numeric sorting
of numeric codes by default.


<h4>Obsolete Codes</h4>

When the time comes to retire a code from active use
there are two approaches:  deletion or deprecation.
The problem with deletion is that the code value may
still exist somewhere in the database.  When it comes
time to display the code description for a deleted
code value only the actual code value is available
which can be rather cryptic.

<p>
The solution is to mark obsolete codes as deprecated
without removing them from the code set. This leaves
the obsolete code descriptions in the code set for
display purposes, but does not allow new data entry
selection of deprecated code choices.

<p>
To deprecate a code click the "Deprecated" checkbox
and then click [Update].


<h4>User Permissions</h4>

The Translation Utility contains hooks to allow
or disallow any combination of code addition,
update, or deletion.  Combined with user authentication
these hooks can be set up to give different users different
privileges for different code sets and languages.
