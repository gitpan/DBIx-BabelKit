BabelKit Universal Multilingual Database Code Table
---------------------------------------------------

BabelKit Version 1.07 released 2003.05.12.

BabelKit is an interface to a universal multilingual
database code table. BabelKit takes all of the
programming work out of maintaining multiple database
code definition sets in multiple languages.

The code administration and translation page lets you define
new virtual code tables, new languages, enter all codes
and their descriptions and then translate them into all
languages of interest.

Perl and PHP classes retrieve the code descriptions
and automatically generate HTML code selection elements
in the user's language.  This makes internationalization
and localization of web sites and database interfaces
much easier.  The home page contains live multilanguage
demos.
